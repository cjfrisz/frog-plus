# Frog+

A script for use with Greg Hendershott's
[Frog](https://github.com/greghendershott/frog) that makes it into
a first-class citizen and streamlines some basic workflows for
writing blog posts, building/previewing the associated website, and
deploying it to a remote hosting server.

## Installation

Simply put the `frog` script into your path.

Assumes that Frog is already installed and configured (which itself
requires [Racket](http://racket-lang.org)). Also uses the Z shell
(zsh) and some utilities/options that may only work on Mac.
